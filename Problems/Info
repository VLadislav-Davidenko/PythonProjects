Mathematical Functions
1	abs(x)
	The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.

2	ceil(x)
	The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x

3	cmp(x, y)
	-1 if x < y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x > y

4	exp(x)
	The exponential of x: ex

5	fabs(x)
	The absolute value of x.

6	floor(x)
	The floor of x: the largest integer not greater than x

7	log(x)
	The natural logarithm of x, for x> 0

8	log10(x)
	The base-10 logarithm of x for x> 0.

9	max(x1, x2,...)
	The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity

10	min(x1, x2,...)
	The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity

11	modf(x)
	The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple. Both parts have the same sign as x. The integer part is returned as a float.

12	pow(x, y)
	The value of x**y.

13	round(x [,n])
	x rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0.

14	sqrt(x)
	The square root of x for x > 0

Random Number Functions

1	choice(seq)
	A random item from a list, tuple, or string.

2	randrange ([start,] stop [,step])
	A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

3	random()
	A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1

4	seed([x])
	Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Returns None.

5	shuffle(lst)
	Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns None.

6	uniform(x, y)
	A random float r, such that x is less than or equal to r and r is less than y

Trigonometric Functions

1	acos(x)
	Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.

2	asin(x)
	Return the arc sine of x, in radians.

3	atan(x)
	Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.

4	atan2(y, x)
	Return atan(y / x), in radians.

5	cos(x)
	Return the cosine of x radians.

6	hypot(x, y)
	Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y).

7	sin(x)
	Return the sine of x radians.

8	tan(x)
	Return the tangent of x radians.

9	degrees(x)
	Converts angle x from radians to degrees.

10	radians(x)
	Converts angle x from degrees to radians.

Escape Characters

\a	0x07	Bell or alert
\b	0x08	Backspace
\cx	 		Control-x
\C-x	 	Control-x
\e	0x1b	Escape
\f	0x0c	Formfeed
\M-\C-x	 	Meta-Control-x
\n	0x0a	Newline
\nnn	 	Octal notation, where n is in the range 0.7
\r	0x0d	Carriage return
\s	0x20	Space
\t	0x09	Tab
\v	0x0b	Vertical tab
\x	 	Character x
\xnn	 	Hexadecimal notation, where n is in the range 0.9, a.f, or A.F

String Special Operators

+	Concatenation - Adds values on either side of the operator	a + b will give 	HelloPython
*	Repetition - Creates new strings, concatenating multiple copies of the same 	string	a*2 will give -HelloHello
[]	Slice - Gives the character from the given index	a[1] will give e
[ : ]	Range Slice - Gives the characters from the given range	a[1:4] will 			give ell
in	Membership - Returns true if a character exists in the given string	H in a 		will give 1
not in	Membership - Returns true if a character does not exist in the given			string	M not in a will give 1
r/R	Raw String - Suppresses actual meaning of Escape characters. The syntax for 	raw strings is exactly the same as for normal strings with the exception of 	the raw string operator, the letter "r," which precedes the quotation 			marks. The "r" can be lowercase (r) or uppercase (R) and must be placed 		immediately preceding the first quote mark.	print r'\n' prints \n and print 	R'\n'prints \n
%	Format - Performs String formatting	See at next section
